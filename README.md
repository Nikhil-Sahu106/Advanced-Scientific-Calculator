# Advanced Scientific Calculator in C++
An Advanced Scientific Calculator using C++ Language. It includes all major functions a calculator uses.

## Advantages
This gives us a better understanding of cpp programming and will give broader idea about the functions using through cpp.

## Includes
- Basic Mathematical operators (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, etc.)
- Trigonometric Operators (Sin, Cos, Tan, Cot, Cosec, Sec)
- Scientific Calculator Operators (Power, Factorial, Reciprocal, Logarithm, Log10, Exponential function, Nth-Root, etc.)
- Complex Operations (complex Addition, complex Substraction, complex Multipication)
- Inverse Trigonometric Operatations (Sin Inverse, Cos Inverse, Tan Inverse, Cot Inverse, Cosec Inverse, Sec Inverse)
